## [Two Sum](https://neetcode.io/problems/two-integer-sum?list=blind75)
*  Easy Problem

### Solution(s)

#### Hash Map (Dictionary)
##### Intuition
For each number in the input array:
1. Calculate its complement (target - current_number).
2. Check if this complement is already a key in the dictionary.
3. If it is, the pair if found! Return the current index and the index stored in the dictionary for that complement.
4. If it's not, add the current_number and its index to the dictionary, preparing for future numbers to find it as their complement.
5. Return Condition: Return the pair of indices [current_index, dictionary[complement_key]] as soon as the complement is found.

```py
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        hashMap = {}
        for i, n in enumerate(nums):
            diff = target - n
            if diff in hashMap:
                return [hashMap[diff], i]
            hashMap[n] = i
```
##### Time & Space Complexity
* Time complexity: $O(n)$
* Space complexity: $O(n)$

#### Brute Force
##### Intuition
1. Pick the first number (`index_i`).
2. Look at every number after it (at `index_j`).
3. Check if `nums[index_i] + nums[index_j]` equals your `target`.
```py
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
                if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                    return [i, j]
```
##### Time & Space Complexity
* Time complexity: $O(n^2)$
* Space complexity: $O(1)$
