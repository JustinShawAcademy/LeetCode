## [11. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=n4zsywl6)
*  Medium Problem

### Intuition
start wide and move the shorter pointer inward, as this is the only way to potentially increase the area. We use `max()` to keep score while moving

### Solution(s)
#### Two Pointer
```py
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        
        l, r = 0, len(height) - 1
        container = 0

        while l < r:
            area = min(height[l], height[r]) * (r - l)
            container = max(container, area)

            if height[l] < height[r]:
                l += 1
            else:
                r -= 1
        
        return container
```
##### Time & Space Complexity
* Time complexity: $O(n)$
* Space complexity: $O(1)$
