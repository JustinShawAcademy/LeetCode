## [875. Koko Eating Bananas]([https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/description/))
**Difficulty:** Medium | **Topic:** Binary Search 

#### Complexity
* **Time:** $O(nlogn)$
* **Space:** $O(1)$

#### Intuition
1. Identify the lower and upper bounds of the search
2. Do a bisect across the search space

#### Code
```python
import math

class Solution:
    def minEatingSpeed(self, piles: List[int], h: int) -> int:
        l = 1 # Starting eating speed
        r = max(piles) # max eating speed - at this speed, Koko finishes eating by len(piles) hours
        min_speed = r

        # Search through l to r with BS
        while l <= r:
            speed = (r - l) // 2 + l 

            # Update current min speed
            hours_taken = 0
            for pile in piles:
                hours_taken += math.ceil(pile / speed)

            if hours_taken > h:
                # speed too slow, search for higher speed
                l = speed + 1
            else:
                min_speed = min(min_speed, speed)

                # try searching for a lower speed
                r = speed - 1

        return min_speed
```
