Alternatively use the deduping nature of a set.
This solution may not be as fast as the above, but feels easier to reason.
```py
class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        original_length = len(nums)
        deduped_length = len(set(nums))

        return original_length != deduped_length
```
