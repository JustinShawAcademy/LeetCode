## 128. [Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/description/)
**Difficulty:** Medium | **Topic:** Hash Set, Hash Map, Sorting 

#### Intuition
The optimal time complexity is O(n). 

Start by finding the beginning of the sequence; then count forward for the count the consecutive sequence.
Make sure to use HashSet to allow O(1) retrieval.

#### Complexity
* **Time:** $O(n)$
* **Space:** $O(n)$

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Allows O(1) retrieval
        nums_set = set(nums)
        longest_count = 0

        # Make sure to loop over the set to avoid duplicates
        for num in nums_set:
            # Find the beginning of the consecutive sequence
            if num - 1 in nums_set:
                continue
            
            # Count consecutive sequence from the first num
            sequence_count = 1
            current_num = num
            while current_num + 1 in nums_set:
                sequence_count += 1
                current_num += 1
            longest_count = max(sequence_count, longest_count)

        return longest_count
```

#### Alternatives
1. **Sort the array first**: this works but the time complexity becomes O(nlogn)
2. **Hash map interval merging**: `map[n]` stores length of the consecutive sequence that n belongs to, but only the boundary points store correct lengths. (Tbh, I'm still lost for this solution)
