## [1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)
**Difficulty:** Easy | **Topic:** Hash Map 

### Approach 1: Hash Map
#### Intuition
We can solve the problem in a single pass by iterating through the array and checking if the complement of the current element exists in the hash map. If it does not exist, we store the element and index into the hash map. If it does exisits, we then can return the index of that complement and the index of the current element

#### Algorithm
1. First initialize the hash map / dictionary so that we may store the value and index of each element in the array, `hashMap = {}`.
2. For each element in the array, check if the complement exisits in the hash map, `diff = target - nums[i]`.
3. If it exists, return the index of the complement and the index of the current element, `return hashMap[diff], i`.
4. If it does not exists, store the num and index into the hashmap, `hashMap[num] = i`

#### Complexity
* **Time:** $O(n)$
* **Space:** $O(n)$

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:

        hashMap = {} # value: index

        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            diff = target - num
            if diff in hashMap:
                return hashMap[diff], i
            hashMap[num] = i
```
