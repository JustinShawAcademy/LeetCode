## 271. [Encode and Decode Strings](https://neetcode.io/problems/string-encode-and-decode/question)
**Difficulty:** Medium | **Topic:** String Slicing

#### Intuition
##### Encoding
For every string in the list, we will prepend the length of it, as well as a delimiter `#`. For each string the formate will look like `length#string`. We then append it to the returned string `res`. We do this because the `#` character acts as a clear boundary between the length and the actual content, and using the length ensures we know exactly how many characters to read—no matter what characters appear in the string itself.

##### Decoding
During decoding, we simply read characters until we reach `#` to find the length, then extract exactly that many characters as the string.

#### Algorithm
##### Encoding
1. Initalize the empty string, the main string to return
2. For each string in the list,
    - prepend the len of each string
    - prepend the delimiter `#` (can be other symbols too such as $, @, &, etc)
    - Append it to the main string. 
        - Each append should be in the formate `"length#string"`
3. Return the main string

##### Decoding
1. Initialize pointers `i` = 0 and `j` = 0 and an empty list for the decoded strings.
2. While `i` is in the bounds of the encoding string:
    - Move the pointer j until it reaches `#`
    - Captuer the length using string indexing, `length = s[i:j]`
        - Convert it into type `int`
    - Move `i` to the first character of `#`, `i = j + 1`
    - Move `j` to the beginning of the next `#`, `j = i + length`
    - Capture the string using string indexing, `s[i:j]`
    - Append the captured string into the list
    - Return `i` to `j`, so that they may be in the beginning of the next `#` 
3. Return the list of decoded strings


#### Complexity
* **Time:** $O(m)$: For each $encode()$ and $decode()$
* **Space:** $O(m + n)$: For each $encode()$ and $decode()$

> Where $m$ is the sum of lengths of all the strings and $n$ is the number of all strings

#### Code
```python
class Solution:

    def encode(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
        res = ''
        for s in strs:
            res += str(len(s)) + '#' + s
        return res

    def decode(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
        i, j = 0, 0
        res = []
        
        while i < len(s):
            while s[j] != '#':
                j += 1
            length = int(s[i:j])
            i = j + 1
            j = i + length
            res.append(s[i:j])
            i = j

        return res

```
