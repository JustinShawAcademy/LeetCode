## 238. [Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/description/)
**Difficulty:** Medium | **Topic:** Array

#### Intuition
Pre-compute products to avoid nested for loops

#### Algorithm
1. Compute left pass: products of all elements left to the current element
2. Compute right pass: products of all elements right to the current element
3. Compute final results

#### Complexity
* **Time:** $O(n)
* **Space:** $O(3n)

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        left_pass = [1 for _ in range(len(nums))] # stores products of all elements left to the current element
        right_pass = [1 for _ in range(len(nums))] # stores products of all elements right to the current element
        results = [] 

        # Left pass
        left_pass_product = left_pass[0]
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            prev_num = nums[i - 1]
            left_pass_product *= prev_num
            left_pass[i] = left_pass_product

        # Right pass
        right_pass_product = right_pass[len(nums) - 1]
        for i in range(len(nums) - 2, -1, -1): # backward step
            prev_num = nums[i + 1]
            right_pass_product *= prev_num
            right_pass[i] = right_pass_product
        
        # Put everything together
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            result = left_pass[i] * right_pass[i]
            results.append(result)
        
        return results
```

#### Further optimization
Store left_pass and right_pass directly into results list - space complexity becomes O(n)
