## 242. [Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/)
**Difficulty:** Easy | **Topic:** Hash map

### Approach 1: Hash Map
#### Intuition
If two strings are valid anagrams, they will have the same frequencys of characters. We may count the how many times a characters appears using a hash maps by tracking the frequency of every character in each string. If the hash maps are equal to each other, an anagram exists 

#### Algorithm
1. Return `False` if the strings have two different lengths (it's impossible for them to be anagrams)
2. Create two hash maps to store character frequencies for each string.
3. Iterate through both strings at the same time:
    * Increase the character count for s[i] in the first map.
    * Increase the character count for t[i] in the second map.
4. After building both maps, compare them:
    * If the maps are equal, return True.
    * Otherwise, return False.

#### Complexity
* **Time:** $O(n + m)$ (two inputs) 
* **Space:** $O(1)$ (The dictionary will always max out to 26 keys as there are 26 alpha chars)

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:

        if len(s) != len(t):
            return False
        
        dict_s, dict_t = {}, {}

        for i in range(len(s)):
            dict_s[s[i]] = 1 + dict_s.get(s[i], 0)
            dict_t[t[i]] = 1 + dict_t.get(t[i], 0)
        
        return dict_s == dict_t
```

Alternatively use Counter from Python collections module.
This is the same logic as the solution above but with fewer lines of code.

```python
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        source_dict = Counter(s)
        target_dict = Counter(t)

        return source_dict == target_dict
```
