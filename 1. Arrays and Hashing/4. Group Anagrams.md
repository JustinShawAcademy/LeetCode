## [49. Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/description/)
**Difficulty:** Medium | **Topic:** Sorting, Dictionary 

### Approach 1: Sorting / Dictionary
#### Intuition
Since anagrams are identical when their characters are sorted, we can use the sorted version of each string as a key into the dictionary, grouping them all together. 

#### Algorithm
1. Initialize a `defauldict` that will map the sorted version of a string to a list of original strings
2. Iterate through each string `s` in the input `strs`
3. Sort the current string to create the key (since anagrams sort to the same string)
4. Append the original string `s` into the list inside the dictionary
5. Return the values of the dictionary as a list. Final output is a list of list.

#### Complexity
* **Time:** $O(N \cdot K \log K)$
    * Where $N$ is the number of strings and $K$ is the maximum length of a string (because we sort everything and sorted = $K \log K$)
* **Space:** $O(N \cdot K)$
    * Where $N$ is how many words we have and $K$ is how much data we have in each word

#### Code
```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        groups = defaultdict(list)
        for s in strs:
            sorted_str = str(sorted(s)) # or ''.join(storted(s)) 
            groups[sorted_str].append(s)

        return list(groups.values())
```
